# Prototype Theme 3 - BullsEye

The third prototype theme was set to be built around Constraints. 
The Constraints are as follows.
- Use six thinking hats in all BS
- No non-diegetic UI
- No genre conventions
- No Combat
- No direct inspiration from games, media etc.

The game idea is a mash-up of the finalists that was generated during the brainstorming session using our 6 thinking hats.

- You're a metal milk jug whose objective is to knock down as many cows as you can.
- Meteor either trying to dodge or hit planets in the solar system or galaxy.

Developed in Unreal Engine 4
